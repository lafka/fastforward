                FWT Fast Forward - eZ Publish Template Framework
================================================================================
Fast Forward is aimed to be a replacement to the now outdated eZ Webin extension.
By working with conventions over configuration we can avoid using uneccasery
tempalte overrides pr. content class and instead follow an already defined file-
structure; it has never been quicker to create custom templates in eZ Publish.

FastForward is developed and maintained by Frengstad Web Teknologi (http://fwt.no)

==  Dependencies

FastForward uses the blueprint css framework (www.blueprintcss.org) and famfamfam
silk icon set.

==  Getting FWT Fast Forward sources from GIT

    This methods requires a working linux system with git package installed.

    To install fastforward open up a new terminal window, then navigate to the
    eZ Publish extension directory.

    $Â git clone http://github.com/lafka/fwtfastforward.git

==  Enabling the extension in eZ Publish admin interface

    You can enable the extension by logging into your admin siteaccess:

    * Go to the "Setup" tab
    * Fint the "INI-settings" link in left column and click it
    * In the first drop down select "site.ini"
    * In the second select the siteaccess you want to enable the extension for
    * Scrolldown to "ExtensionSettings" and click the edit icon located to the
      right of the "ActiveExtensions" line.
    * Add a new line saying "=fwtfastforward"

==  Creating a basic extension of FastForward

    We will use the name "t-ext" for our extension, you would want to switch this
    to something related to your project.


    Create the folder structure:

    * Create the folder "t-ext" under eZ Publish extension dir
    * Create the folder "settings" under "t-ext"
    * Create the folder "design" under "t-ext"
    * Create the folder "t-ext" under "design" 
    ( Alternative run this command from  you eZ Publish root: $ mkdir -p extensions/t-ext/design/t-ext/templates/ extensions/t-ext/design/t-ext/stylesheet extensions/t-ext/settings/ )


    Add the settings needed:
    * Create the file "design.ini.append.php" under "t-ext/settings"
    * If the block "ExtensionSettings" don't extist create it.
    * Add "DesignExtensions[]=t-ext" line under the ExtensionSettings"
    
    You can now start creating you site

==  Creating a custom template for content class: folder

    In your new extension create the following directories:

    design/t-ext/templates/
    design/t-ext/templates/content
    design/t-ext/templates/content/view/
    design/t-ext/templates/content/view/folder/
    
    Now if we want to create our new template for the full view of folders you just
    add a the full.tpl in here: design/t-ext/templates/content/view/folder/
